Hey there! I'm Jacob, a web developer from Canada looking for a new opportunity. I'm confident with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS, and Node.js.

## Projects

### Unofficial Anilist Extension

This is my most recent project. It is a browser extension built using React that connects the Anilist's official GraphQL API.

The extension is a mini version of [Anilist](https://anilist.co), which is a anime/manga database website. I built this extension because I wanted an easier way to update my list entries and I knew that they had a very extensive public API.

My main goal for this project was to familiarize myself with GraphQL.

### Site Tracker Browser Extension

This was my second project. It's a browser extension built with vanilla JavaScript and makes extensive use of the browser's WebExtensions API.

The extension itself keeps track of the sites you visit so that you can see where you've been spending/wasting your time. It also has the ability to block and redirect sites.

The main thing I learned while working on this project was how to effectively use documentation. Since this was the first time I had built a web extension, I went into the project with no knowledge of the area. Thankfully MDN has extensive [documentation for the WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) which taught me all I needed to know.

### Storefront

This was my first project. The front-end is an SPA built using React and TypeScript, while the back-end is a REST API built using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. The database uses PostgreSQL.

The site itself is a mock ecommerce site.

Since this was the first time that I built something by completely by myself, my goal was to get comfortable using JavaScript, React, CSS, and Node.js.
